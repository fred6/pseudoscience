 - move convert() to renderer? i think markdown/rst => html output should be part of the renderer
 - if a template changes you have to recompile all the files that utilize that template
 - remove files from out_dir that are not legitimate outputs of compilation (i.e. a file is compiled to a.html, then rerouted to b.html and recompiled. a.html should be deleted)
 - metadata
 - tags/categories
 - add "draft" capability, i.e. pages in site/ that dont get compiled
