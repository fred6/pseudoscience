 - encapsulate file writing into one thing so we dont import os and do all this folder existence checking in multiple places
 - if a template changes you have to recompile all the files that utilize that template
 - make "identity renderer" for files that just get copied straight out. add this configuration to config.py
 - metadata
 - tags/categories
 - add "draft" capability, i.e. pages in site/ that dont get compiled
